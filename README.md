# Command & Conquer Generals: Zero Hour — macOS, iOS & iPadOS

<img width="500" height="281" alt="IMG_3457_500" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aeaf6692-36e6-40c8-b9f8-8066d014ec4b" />

**Zero Hour running natively on Apple Silicon Macs, iPhone, and iPad** — campaign,
skirmish, and Generals Challenge, with touch controls built for RTS (tap-select,
drag-box, long-press deselect, two-finger scroll, pinch zoom). No emulation: this
is the real 2003 engine compiled for ARM64, rendering DirectX 8 →
[DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk) → Vulkan →
[MoltenVK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK) → Metal.

Built on EA's GPL v3 source release, standing on a chain of community work —
[TheSuperHackers](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode),
[Fighter19's original Unix port](https://github.com/Fighter19/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour), and
[fbraz3/GeneralsX](https://github.com/fbraz3/GeneralsX) — this fork adds the iOS/iPadOS
port and a set of engine fixes. See [Lineage & credits](#lineage--credits) for who built
what. The original GeneralsX README lives on the `upstream-main` branch.

**No game assets are included or distributed.** You need your own copy
([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2732960/), ~$5 on sale).

## Quick start — macOS

Prerequisites (one time):

```sh
# Toolchain
xcode-select --install
brew install cmake ninja meson pkgconf
brew install --cask steamcmd

# vcpkg (full clone — a shallow clone breaks manifest baselines)
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg ~/vcpkg && ~/vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_ROOT=~/vcpkg          # add to your shell profile

# LunarG Vulkan SDK (NOT the Homebrew cask) — https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home
export VULKAN_SDK=$HOME/VulkanSDK/<version>/macOS   # add to your shell profile
```

Clone, build, get assets, play:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ammaarreshi/Generals-Mac-iOS-iPad.git GeneralsX
cd GeneralsX
./scripts/build/macos/build-macos-zh.sh     # checks deps, configures, builds
./scripts/build/macos/deploy-macos-zh.sh    # creates ~/GeneralsX/GeneralsZH + run.sh
./scripts/get-assets.sh <your_steam_username>   # fetches game data you own
cd ~/GeneralsX/GeneralsZH && ./run.sh -win
```

## Quick start — iPhone / iPad

On top of the macOS prerequisites: full Xcode (signed into your Apple ID),
`brew install xcodegen`, and a (free or paid) Apple Developer team.

```sh
cd GeneralsX
git submodule update --init references/fbraz3-dxvk   # iOS DXVK is built from this + Patches/dxvk-ios.patch
./scripts/build/ios/fetch-moltenvk.sh                # pinned MoltenVK.framework (checksummed)
./scripts/build/ios/stage-fonts.sh                   # Liberation fonts, renamed as the game expects
cmake --preset ios-vulkan
cmake --build build/ios-vulkan --target z_generals
GX_TEAM_ID=<your-team-id> GX_BUNDLE_ID=com.you.generalszh \
    ./scripts/build/ios/package-ios-zh.sh --install  # assembles, signs, installs
```

Find your team id in Xcode → Settings → Accounts. Assets ship inside the app
bundle (self-contained install); `--dev` skips the ~2.7 GB copy for fast code
iteration.

## Known issues

- Long sessions on iPad can be killed by iOS for memory (~3 GB+ resident); the app
  exits to the home screen with no dialog. Session logs (current + previous) are in
  the Files app under the game's folder. Under investigation.
- Backgrounding mid-game can occasionally crash on iOS — the lifecycle pause covers
  the common paths; a rare race remains. Save often.

## Lineage & credits

This port is the newest link in a long chain, and the earlier links did foundational
work that this repo inherits everywhere:

- **Westwood / EA Pacific** — the game; **EA** — the GPL v3 source release
- **[TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode)** —
  the community mainline: build modernization, VC6→modern toolchain, and much of the
  cross-platform groundwork, including the FFmpeg video backend authored by
  **[feliwir](https://github.com/feliwir)** (of [OpenSAGE](https://github.com/OpenSAGE/OpenSAGE)),
  who also authored the OpenAL audio device work this port's audio stack builds on
- **[Fighter19/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour](https://github.com/Fighter19/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour)** —
  the original Unix/64-bit port: SDL3 platform management, C++17
  filesystem/threading, Freetype/Fontconfig text rendering, and the DXVK approach
  this renderer path descends from
- **[fbraz3/GeneralsX](https://github.com/fbraz3/GeneralsX)** — the macOS/Linux port
  this fork builds on directly, integrating and extending the above
- **This fork** — the iOS/iPadOS port (arm64-ios cross-build, DXVK-on-iOS, touch
  controls, app lifecycle, packaging) and engine fixes, offered upstream
- **DXVK, MoltenVK, SDL, OpenAL Soft, FFmpeg, Liberation Fonts** — the load-bearing walls

Engine code **GPL v3** (EA's source release → the chain above → this fork). Game
assets: not included, not licensed here.

This port was built as a human+AI collaboration: engineering by
[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (Anthropic's Claude, Fable model),
directed and playtested on real devices by Ammaar Reshi. The engineering log in
`docs/port/` is the unedited record of how that worked.
